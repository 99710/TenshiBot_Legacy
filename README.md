<h2> Known issues </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bot takes forever to startup - Likely due to my crappy single core VPS its running on</li>
  <li>Only 1 command prefix can be added - AFAIK this is a limitation of the base code. i have experimented with this with no luck</li>
  
</ul>

<h2> Todo (at some point) </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make image commands pull images from danbooru/pixiv instead of locally</li>
  <li>Add @mention command prefix, "=" is used for other bots which causes some clashes</li>
  <li>Rewrite the base code, current base code was never designed for this and is slow at starting up</li>
  
</ul>
